# Workspaces directory (Work in progress)
Moonlight not working yet!!, also slack is outdated.
This directory is for storing all the files needed for your workspaces store, they should be stored with the following structure:

* workspaces/Workspace Name
* workspaces/Workspace Name/workspace.json
* workspaces/Workspace Name/workspace-name.png

example registry:
https://baalspawn.github.io/kasm-registry/1.0/
https://kasmregistry.linuxserver.io/1.0/
